# BookNotes ðŸ“–

## An app that digitalizes your home library ðŸ’»ðŸ“š

Do you own a lot of books at home? Ever wonder if you already have a particular book when you're at the book shop? Well fear no longer, BookNotes is here to solve your issue! This app allows you to search books by author or title. When a match is found you can add the book to your library. Of course a pretty thumbnail picture will aid in displaying your collection in the Library section of the app. Great news right? Now you will stop doubling up on books... which means your stocking stuffer inventory will be depleted, but you can always fall back on the classic sock option.

3. Searching and Adding
   
    Enter a book title or authors name into the search bar and click search. Warning, you may get a similar rush to when you run your fingers over the        spins of books on a shelf at your local book shop. It would be rude of me not to disclose this.

## Set up the project

### Install Node and NPM

`npm` is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get `npm` installed on your computer. You can install Node by [downloading it from the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on a macOS or Linux device or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) on a Windows device.
